## Introduction
OpenHarmony is a rapidly expanding open-source operating system. With its deployment on over 100 million commercial devices, it has emerged as one of the most popular open-source OS platforms in the mobile industry. It offers a wealth of research possibilities by enabling more seamless integration and co-design between the operating system and its underlying hardware architecture.
This tutorial is designed as a hands-on learning journey into OpenHarmony. We'll embark on a detailed exploration of the OpenHarmony operating system, delving into its core principles and structural design. The tutorial will encompass several key areas:

* **Introduction to OpenHarmony Architecture:** we’ll begin with an overview of the evolving mobile OS landscape, emphasizing the unique features and architecture of OpenHarmony.
* **Practical Development and Prototyping:** step-by-step instructions will guide you through building system security prototypes, utilizing underlying synchronization primitives, and designing scalable data structures. Additionally, we’ll cover the experience of porting existing applications to OpenHarmony.
* **Innovative Experimentation and System Research:** finally, we’ll demonstrate how OpenHarmony enables novel research ideas and supports reliable experimentation for researchers and system designers.
By the end, participants will have gained a comprehensive, practical understanding of OpenHarmony’s potential in system research and development.

The tutorial will cover the following key topics:

1. Understanding the evolving landscape of mobile operating systems, elaborating the features and architecture of OpenHarmony.
2. Step-by-step guidance on building system security prototypes (TEE, application authority) based on OpenHarmony.
3. Step-by-step guidance on building an scalable concurrent data structure in OpenHarmony with formal methods
4. Step-by-step guidance on how to develop OpenHarmony applications, as well as how to port existing applications into OpenHarmony
5. Demonstrating how OpenHarmony enables novel research ideas and supports reliable experimentation for researchers and system designers.
