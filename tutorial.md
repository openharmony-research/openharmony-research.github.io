## Introduction

In the swiftly changing world of technology, mobile operating systems are advancing towards a more distributed, interconnected, and intelligent framework. This evolution demands the creation of operating systems and hardware architectures that are not only secure but also exhibit peak performance and user-friendly simplicity. OpenHarmony (https://openharmony.cn/) stands at the forefront of this revolution as a cutting-edge operating system. It enables developers to craft secure, interconnected mobile ecosystems through a synergistic approach of hardware-OS co-design. This tutorial offers a comprehensive look into the development of futuristic mobile operating systems and architectural designs, using OpenHarmony as the pivotal platform.

In this tutorial, our main goal is to facilitate a practical learning journey. We'll embark on a detailed exploration of the OpenHarmony operating system, delving into its core principles and structural design. The tutorial will encompass several key areas: firstly, constructing system security prototypes within the OpenHarmony framework, with an emphasis on integrating Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) like RISC-V Penglai. Secondly, we'll focus on utilizing OpenHarmony's distributed hardware abstraction capabilities to efficiently connect multiple OpenHarmony devices. Lastly, we will cover the "develop once, run anywhere" paradigm, emphasizing the cross-platform compatibility of OpenHarmony.

The tutorial will cover the following key topics:

1. Understanding the evolving landscape of mobile operating systems and their security requirements.
2. Familiarizing yourself with the features and architecture of OpenHarmony.
3. Step-by-step guidance on building system security prototypes (TEE, application authority) based on OpenHarmony.
4. Step-by-step guidance on building an interconnected system using the distributed capability based on OpenHarmony (e.g., distributed TEE).
5. Step-by-step guidance on how to develop OpenHarmony applications once but run on different platforms
6. Demonstrating how OpenHarmony and related systems facilitate novel ideas and reliable experimentation for researchers and system designers.

This tutorial is designed for researchers, system designers, and developers interested in exploring and harnessing the potential of OpenHarmony to create next-generation mobile OS solutions. Prior knowledge of operating systems and basic programming concepts would be beneficial.

**Join us (!!!)** in this tutorial to unlock new opportunities and pave the way for secure, interconnected and efficient mobile systems using OpenHarmony.
