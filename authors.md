    <strong>Yubin Xia</strong>
    <p>I am a professor in School of Software at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a member of Institute of Parallel And Distributed Systems (IPADS).</p>
    <p>My research interests include operating systems, computer architecture. Currently, I'm now focusing on hardware-software co-design for better performance and isolation. Some recent projects by my students and colleagues include the Penglai (蓬莱) RISC-V TEE, the XPC architecture extension for fast IPC, the Catalyzer serverless framework with &lt; 1ms startup latency, the ServerlessBench test suit for serverless frameworks, and the DeSearch search engine for web3.</p>

    <strong>Dong Du</strong>
    <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute of parallel and distributed systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>
    <p>My research interests include operating systems, architecture, system security (TEE), serverless computing and HW/SW co-design. I have built several systems including Penglai TEE (state-of-the-art RISC-V TEE), serverless systems (Catalyzer, ServerlessBench, and Molecule), and RISC-V IPC extension (XPC). I am also working on open-sourced communities, including RISC-V (SPMP TG chair), openEuler (RISC-V SIG maintainer) and OpenHarmony (RISC-V and TEE SIG maintainer).</p>
